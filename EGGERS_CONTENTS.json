Break into groups and working together, incorporate the code that handles firebase storage uploads into your IG clone project.\n\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. The upload should happen on the frontend, perhaps on a **upload.html** page.\n2. **After** the upload is complete and you have the **downloadURL** strings, make a request to **your IG Clone API** that will create a new post with the **downloadURL** as the image source. \n3. Make sure that your upload.html route sits behind some sort of authentication - or, **add security rules** to firebase itself. It's probably easier to put your upload logic behind your own authentication wall tho in the scenario.","idx":4},"babel":{"content":"# Babel\n\nIf we have time, we will discuss briefly.\n\n**[Clone this repo](https://github.com/mottaquikarim/nycda_supersimple_babel_example)** and we will get started.","idx":5},"__list__":["home","title","desc","setting-up-firebase","extra-practice","babel"]}
